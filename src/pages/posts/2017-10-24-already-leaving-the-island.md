Already leaving the island, awake at 4am after a dismal sweat drenched half sleep. The last evening and out with the Swedes and an Ozzie, dinner at a swanky neighbouring hotel. Sitting outside by the sea and a Frank Sinatra wind blows. Talk of swells, surf, sharks and the Friday night out in Jungle, as Siargao's best pizza and pasta is served. Max tells a rollicking story how he and his brother, surfing in Canada, saw a huge cathedral shaped fin heading straight at him. Max tucked his knees up on the board, his brother riding the foam ashore. As it cruised by at practically touching distance, the massive black shape with splashes of white, turned out to be an Orca. Lawrence came back with a bunch of shark stories, although not the grisliest he had earlier recounted. Today's main dinner story was about a whitey. While surfing on the gold coast he saw a baby dolphin was swimming evasively, leaping out of the water, suddenly a big great white loomed up and bit it in half. Luckily there are very few sharks in the Philippines, unfortunately few dolphins too. The illegal practice of dynamiting the reefs is still common. And the crocidile release programme is spluttering, all the big 3 metre salties have been eaten, or hide deep in the mangroves out of sight. There is a rumour about a big lone tiger shark at Stimpies surf spot, and spurious sightings told by surfers, although usually to scare people away from their favourite spots.

At 4.30am am downstairs with my bags, Pal gets up to make me a farewell coffee. I will see him later in Cebu for a reunion with Tim and then onto KL and Borneo. Still, it's always sad to leave the island and the photo of the departees is ritualistically observed, no matter what time. It's still dark as I climb aboard the habble habble and we putter into the night. On the outskirts of GL I tap the driver on the shoulder indicating for him to stop, on the side of the road they are baking little sweet loaves of bread, I buy four and we share them. There is no other traffic until we get near to Dapa and I'm dropped at the port in plenty of time. The firsy booth you buy the ticket, around 5 euro, the next booth, pay a small tax, 20 cents, then before boarding there is another booth and a 20 cent tax, and finally a man sitting at a table where you sign your name, age and nationality.\

On boarding there are a couple of eagles wheeling around the boat, I often see them before this trip, and with the sun peaking out from behind the hill the boats engines roar into life and we power off up the straits on a 3 hour voyage to Siargao city. Sitting right at the back of the boat almost directly above the engine, the hatch is open and the crew move in a practiced and relaxed way up and down the ladder. Everything vibrates and the noise contrasts with the surrounding beauty, mangroves to the right, and precarious fishing villages on stilts, to the left jungle clad hillsides and tropical beaches. The sailors lean on the balcony and smoke, they have seen it a million times and still they watch the islands fall away deep in thought. The wake from the boat is enormous, a thick swell carving the dark blue waters, and the coastguard outboard chases us. Three heavily armed grown men, grinning like children as the pilot rides up and across the waves. Spray showers their boat and he crisscrosses the churning sea displaying his boatmanship before peeling off to resume their coastal patrols. In the port terminal was a reminder that while I'm living in an earthly paradise, then sharks are all too real. A large poster on the wall wildwest style blazes 'Wanted Local Terrorists', and 100 faces or so look back at you. It's a reminder that the region of Mindano is still under marshal law after the ISIS insurrection in the south, and the all out war on drugs has now claimed over 15,000 lives in the last 2 years.
