The child tribe has two modes, happy or sad. They either laugh, sing, skip around giddy and smiling, or slope sullenly, meeting you with a steady gaze containing a thousand years of sadness condensed into their teenage souls. They do everything, but none of it very well, cooking, cleaning, emptying the toilet bins or running errands. Always dutifully but always ineffectively. Päl the manager is frequently exasperated, he explains countless times how a task should be completed, somehow the resort functions, hovering between his frustration and amusement. The tribe sleep in a pile upstairs under the open aired bamboo and straw roof, on mats, in hammocks, their faces illuminated by their mobile phones, as they chat, swap stories and pictures and listen to pop music. There are six of them, they live, work and sleep at the Villa. Päl is building them a house at the back of the property with numbered bunks. He could build another bungalow, the villa is always at capacity and we often turn drop-in customers away. And the children have homes, he could send them away and cram in more backpackers in the space they have taken over. But like the puppies which emerged from under the floor a month ago, the band cannot be broken up until they have been weaned. Two girls already have left employment since the puppies, 17, not quite children but not quite women, both left to have babies. Their boyfriends unemployed or cleaners, marriages hurriedly arranged in this ultra-catholic country , and the girls with a notion that now they should be mothers should quit work. Neither had displayed any outward signs of their new status, both were adament they should leave as ‘for the baby’. The notion they could continue to work somehow alien to them.

The guard will be fired, he carries a torch and ensures the property is safe at night. He is just a kid too, mostly sleeping in his hammock by the wooden gates. But he has been drinking, and another boy will become the guard. He does not look happy about his ‘promotion’ it means separation form the tribe. Ramil sighs deeply, torch in hand he is their mini-chief of the tribe and wants to sleep with the girls who are told roughly but with a tenderness to 'go to bed now'.
